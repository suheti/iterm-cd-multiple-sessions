# iterm-cd-multiple-sessions
Use iTerm to open several sessions under the same tab and cd into different directories

Change directories in `dirs` to customise to your needs.

Written and tested on iTerm2 Build 3.1.1, macOS Sierra 10.12.6

run 
```
osascript start_work.applescript
```

or you can compile it into a `.app` using AppleScript Editor. or `osacompile start_work.applescript`

This is a tweaked version of: https://github.com/bmfurtado/iterm2-cssh  Mainly added the logic to use existing window/session when iterm is already running.
